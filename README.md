This project is an interactive dictionary management system built with React, Node.js, and SQLite. It allows users to create, manage, and delete custom dictionaries, with each dictionary storing a collection of words alongside their definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. The front end is powered by React, providing an intuitive user interface, while the back end is built with Node.js, handling all database operations and API requests. This project showcases the integration of a SQLite database with a modern web application stack, making it a practical tool for anyone looking to organize and manage their own personalized word collections.
